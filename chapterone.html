        <h1>Chapter One</h1>
        <p>Jake awoke with a start to realise that the alarm on his phone had been sounding for at least 5 minutes and
            was now kicking up a hell of a racket.
            Xavi, his half wild, ancient cat lay at the end of the bed. The cat opened one eye, gave Jake a
            disinterested glare, and yawned expressively, showing yellowing teeth.</p>
        <p>Jake's t-shirt felt damp, and smelled badly of tumbler of bourbon he remembered pouring just before he fell
            asleep</p>
        <p>He fell onto the tiled floor beside his bed and realised that hed located the tumbler, which was now in
            pieces on the tiled floor. He stood up and felt a wincing pain in his foot from the broken glass</p>
        <p>He hobbled to the kitchen, attended to his lacerated foot and made some coffee.</p>
        <p>The apartment felt unbelievably cold, and looking out to the street, he realised that last night's wind and
            sleet had turned to snow and everywhere was covered in a blanket of pristine whiteness</p>
        <p>Jake shivered and made his way to the bathroom and commenced his daily ablutions...</p>
        <p>Twenty minutes later, while walking down the steps into the subway, his phone buzzed in his pocket. It was
            Donnelly. He silenced the call and felt a wave of panic wash over him. He wondered at this unusual impulse
            to avoid his old friend and in particular, how he would explain his strange behaviour
            He would only lose signal somewhere under Rockaway like he always did. His ancient iPhone, a cracked and
            battered relic from back in the days of the Obama presidency, barely worked these days</p>
        <p>He closed his eyes and tried to breathe slowly to calm himself</p>
