        <h1>Chapter One</h1>
        <p>Jake awoke with a start to realise that the alarm on his phone had been sounding for at least 5 minutes and
            was now kicking up a hell of a racket.
            Xavi, his half wild, ancient cat lay at the end of the bed. The sleeping cat opened one eye, gave Jake a
            disinterested glare, and yawned expressively, showing yellowing teeth.</p>
        <p>Jake's t-shirt felt damp, and smelled badly of tumbler of bourbon he remembered pouring just before he fell
            asleep</p>
        <p>He fell onto the tiled floor beside his bed and realised that hed located the tumbler, which was now in
            pieces on the tiled floor. He stood up and felt a wincing pain in his foot from the broken glass</p>
        <p>He hobbled to the kitchen, attended to his lacerated foot and made some coffee.</p>
        <p>The apartment felt unbelievably cold, and looking out to the street, he realised that last night's wind and
            sleet had turned to snow and everywhere was covered in a blanket of pristine whiteness</p>
        <p>Jake shivered and made his way to the bathroom and commenced his daily ablutions.</p>
        <p>Twenty minutes later, shaved and looking if not feeling somewhat fresher, his phone buzzed in his pocket halfway down the steps into the subway.</p>
        <p>It was Donnelly. He silenced the call and felt a wave of panic wash over him. He wondered at this unusual impulse
            to avoid his old friend and in particular, how he would explain his strange behaviour last night.
            Anyway, he rationalised to himself, his phone (an ancient Huawei, a battered Android relic from the days of the Obama presidency)
            barely worked these days and would probably lose signal somewhere under Rockaway Park like it always did. Four years ago, when his last phone battery died, he'd had to get a friend who was visiting Macau to source a replacement at a back street stall</p>
        <p>Still, he secretly loved the look on the faces of the younger staffers at the office when he pulled it out. And, unlike the communicator implants most people wore these days, his old Android was very easy to leave behind...</p>
        <p>He entered the subway car and sat down. He closed his eyes and tried to slow his breathing to calm himself. Over the past few days, he' felt this growing sense of impending panic. Scanning around the subway car, he thought he recognised the face of a man who'd just joined at the same subway station as a man he'd seen a few days earlier behind him in the deli.</p>
        <p>In a city the size of New York-Philadelphia, could this just be a coincidence, or perhaps his over-active imagination.</p>
