        <h1>Chapter One</h1>
        <h2>Android phantoms</h2>
        <p>Jake awoke with a start to realise that the alarm on his phone had been sounding for at least 5 minutes and was now kicking up a hell of a racket.
            Xavi, his half-wild, aged cat lay at the end of the bed. The sleeping cat opened one eye, gave Jake a disinterested glare, and yawned expressively, showing yellowing teeth. Jake's t-shirt felt damp, and smelled badly of the tumbler of bourbon he remembered pouring just before he fell
            asleep. He fell out onto the tiled floor beside his bed and realised that he'd located the missing tumbler, which was now in pieces on the tiled floor. He stood up and felt a wincing pain in his foot from the broken glass. He hobbled to the kitchen, attended to his lacerated foot and made some coffee.</p>
        <p>The small dingy apartment felt unbelievably cold, and looking out to the street, he realised that last night's wind and sleet had turned to snow and everywhere was covered in a blanket of pristine whiteness. Jake shivered and made his way to the bathroom and commenced his daily ablutions.</p>
        <p>Twenty minutes later, shaved and looking if not feeling somewhat fresher, his phone buzzed in his pocket halfway down the steps into the subway.
            It was Donnelly. He silenced the call and felt a wave of panic wash over him. He wondered at this unusual impulse to avoid his old friend and in particular, how he would explain his strange behaviour last night.
            Anyway, he rationalised to himself, his phone (an ancient Huawei, a battered Android relic from the Obama era) barely worked these days and would probably lose signal somewhere under Flatbush Avenue like it always did. Four years ago, when his last battery died, he'd had to get a friend who was visiting Macau to source a replacement at a back street stall.</p>
        <p>Still, he secretly loved the look on the faces of the younger staffers at the office when he pulled it out. And, unlike the communicator implants most people wore these days, his old Android was very easy to leave behind.</p>
        <p>He entered the subway car and two stops later, when a seat become free, he sat down, closed his eyes and tried to slow his breathing to calm himself. Over the past few days, he'd felt a growing sense of impending dread, like a shapeless but discernible phantom just out of his line of sight.
            On his way home from the office two nights ago, scanning around the subway car, he thought he recognised the face of a man who'd just joined at the same subway station as being the same man he'd seen earlier that day in the coffee shop on Fourth Avenue. He'd had a palpable sense that the man was watching him while pretending to read the New York Daily News but when he turned around, the man folded his newspaper and looked away.
            In a city the size of New York-Philadelphia, could this just be a coincidence, or was it his over-active imagination?</p>
