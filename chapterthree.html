                <p>Twenty minutes later, Jake left the office and coming downstairs in the elevator , he realised that his back was soaked with sweat. 
				The two agents, assuming that they were Federal agents, as this was never confirmed, tried to catch him offside with a range of leading questions. 
				He didnâ€™t think he gave anything away, and tried his best to appear charming and calm, though inside his heart was pounding.</p>
				<p>They circled around the reason for their visit for a while, at first, making small-talk about the weather, asking Jake about his days in college, before they came to their main line
				of enquiry. Jake, who knew from the moment who they were and why they were there from the moment that he first saw them in Piskorksi's office, played kept his responses to their initial questions low key and to the point</p>
				<p>Finally, they came to it. "Jake, we don't want to waste your time. I'll level with you and tell you while we're here, Your boss that you've been placed on an important investigatation, something about white collar corruption?", the woman said.
				Jake shrugged, "You know I can't talk about my sources". "Sure, of course, we understand that", the man said, "but you know we're all on the same team, you and us. If you find out anything that might of interest to our work, you will be sure to let us know straight away, won't you?".
				He nodded, took the proffered business card and nodded at the two agents and left the room.
