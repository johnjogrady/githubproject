        <h1>Chapter Two</h1>
        <p>When he got to the office, Jake felt a little calmer but taking a deep breath exiting the lift, he realised that he was still quite spooked. He went to the kitchen area, poured himself a mug of coffee and then hunkered down in his cubicle, trying to keep out of sight.
        He scanned quickly through his cryptomails. These didn't contain anything out of the ordinary so as was his usual habit he scanned quickly through the Reuters, Wall Street Journal and BBC RSS feeds on his video display wall.
            These contained the usual dismal news items, mostly from the front. Overnight, North American troops continued to suffer heavy casualties in the ground offensive east of Vienna and had only been saved from complete annihilation by the EU forces when the Russians halted the advancing European forces with drone strikes delivered with surgical precision.
            Nearer to home, two peace protesters camped on the Mall in DC had been shot by a Québécois terrorist who herself was later apprehended and shot dead by the FBI at a Winnipeg gas station. Jake shuddered and wondered at how rapidly things had deteriorated from the relatively settled era before the war.
    <p>
            Piskorksi's bald head appeared in the top right hand corner of this video display wall to rouse Jake from his thoughts. Shit, Jake realised that he did not look happy. They'd worked together for twelve years, Jake as the senior journalist with responsibility for investigative projects and Tadeusz Piskorski, as the news editor at the Star, a liberal leaning local news site with a loyal following across the five boroughs.
            Jake despised Piskorski, and the feeling was definitely mutual, but given they each had their own sphere of influence and activity within the newsroom, they generally managed to tolerate each other, and Jake stayed away from the office and out of Piskorski's way as much possible.
        "I want you in my office, now" barked Piskorksi, emphasising the final word, as Jake wearily roused himself and walked with trepidation to the end of the floor where the editor had his corner office. Piskorksi had a foul temper and was not a man to get on the wrong side of, as Jake had learned on the few previous occasions when they had clashed on Jake's investigative stories, though he didn't frequently interfere in Jake's work.
    </p><p>
            As Piskorksi's office came into view, Jake noticed that the door was closed and the blinds were drawn. This was most unusual as Piskorksi liked to keep a careful watch on his underlings out on the newsroom floor. He was a fastidious, short man who still wore old school rimless glasses despite the fashion for retinal replacements, and very little escaped his attention.
            Stepping into the office, Jake saw that Piskorksi was sitting behind the large walnut desk, which as usual overflowed with paper. Jake realised that there were two other people standing at the window to the left of the editor's desk,  a man and a woman who were both dressed in expensive business attire.
            Jake stood uncertainly for a moment in the doorway until Piskorski told him to close the door and sit down.
            When he entered, noone spoke for a minute or so, and Jake realised that the woman was staring directly at him. She was in her mid thirties, blonde and was tall, elegant and athletic looking. The man was younger and well built, with tight brown cropped hair and he had the blank demeanour of someone who was definitely once in the military, possibly even special forces.
            Jake sat down opposite Piskorksi and turning his brightest smile on the woman asked in what he hoped sounded like a calm voice, "Is there something I can help you folks with?".
            The woman looked at Piskorski and walked over to the front of the desk, and sat down on the front of the desk, immediately in front of Jake.  As she moved, Jake noticed that she was wearing a Glock 23 , the one that used to be the standard issue compact duty pistol for Federal agents back in the day, though Jake remembered that they had changed about two years ago to issuing the newer electronic Sig Sauer model instead.
    </p>
        <p>The woman looked at her watch, glanced in the direction of her colleague who was staring out of the window, with this back to the room, and then addressed Piskorksi directly in a level voice. "Ted, could you excuse us for a few minutes so that we can have a nice quiet talk with Jake here in your office". Pikorski looked uncertain for a moment and then, seeing the resolute look on the woman's face nodded quickly and left the room.</p>
        <p>Once he was gone, the woman's demeanour softened visibly. "You're in a whole world of trouble, Jake", she said in an even voice. "And you need to think very carefully about your next move because I'm afraid things will only get better for you if you cooperate fully with us and answer all of our questions truthfully."</p>
